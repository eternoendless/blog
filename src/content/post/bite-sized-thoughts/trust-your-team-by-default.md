summary: Trust is the foundation of high-performing teams. If you can't trust them, no amount of control will ever be enough.

You inherit a team, or you bring in a new hire. You don't know them. They don't know you. Most managers would play it safe: _"I'll trust them once they prove themselves."_ It feels safe, but it's a mistake.

Distrust leads to micromanagement. It kills ownership, motivation, and speed. No one does their best work when they feel like they're just following orders. 

**Trust should be the default — not a prize unlocked over time.** It creates autonomy, initiative, and accountability. Exactly what you want in a high-performing team.

Trusting by default doesn't mean stepping back and hoping for the best. It needs a framework: set clear expectations of what "good" looks like, define decision boundaries, align regularly, and make yourself available to [support people based on maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory).

"Trust, but verify." Yes — you are responsible for your team. But responsibility doesn't mean policing every move; it means designing a system where people can be trusted. You don't need to personally check everything. Instead, build systems that sustain trust: code reviews, outcome-based accountability (objectives), metrics and observability, retrospectives. These don't kill trust; they make it scalable and objective.

**The best way to find out if someone can be trusted is to trust them.** If you find you can't trust someone to deliver or to escalate when needed, it's not a "trust issue." It's a performance issue.

You don't fix low performance with control. You fix it by building a team you _can_ trust.
