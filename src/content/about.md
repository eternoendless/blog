My name is Pablo Borowicz. I live in Paris, France, and I'm a veteran software developer, team leader and manager. I started building stuff for the web for fun in 1998, and I've been doing that professionally since 2003. 

Back in the day people would categorize me as a full-stack developer, and although this definition is losing popularity these days due to the increasing complexity of each individual stack, I still think that full-stack is the most appropriate description for my domain of competence. That said, PHP is my primary language.

I care deeply about the art of developing software. To paraphrase Steve Jobs, I think that software lies at the intersection of engineering and craftsmanship. Engineering is about cold, hard figures: performance, stability, usefulness. Craftsmanship, on the other hand, is about soft, subjective values: creativity, elegance, beauty. Software development brings the best of both worlds together.

Most of my peers regard me as a very good developer. I don't think that means I'm specially smart; I simply have been doing this for a long time, and that has given me plenty of time to learn.

Indeed, over the years, I learned many lessons about software engineering. A few by reading or attending to conferences, some by talking with my colleagues, and a great many by analyzing my own mistakes. 

This blog aims to share some of that experience, which will hopefully help reduce the global amount of mistakes made by other developers ðŸ˜„.
