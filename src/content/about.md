My name is Pablo Borowicz. I'm a veteran software engineering leader. I started building stuff for the web for fun in 1998, and I've been doing that professionally since 2003. 

I care deeply about the art of developing software. To paraphrase Steve Jobs, I think that software lies at the intersection of engineering and craftsmanship. Engineering is about cold, hard figures: performance, stability, usefulness. Craftsmanship, on the other hand, is about soft, subjective values: creativity, elegance, beauty. Software development brings the best of both worlds together.

Most of my colleagues regard me as a very good developer. I don't think that means I'm special; I simply have been doing this for a long time, and that has given me plenty of time to learn.

Over the years, I have learned many lessons about software engineering. A few by reading or attending to conferences, some by talking with my colleagues, and a great many just by making mistakes. 

I hope that by sharing my experience, I will contribute the tiniest bit to reducing the global amount of mistakes made by other developers.
