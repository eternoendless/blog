      <description>Most non-developers usually struggle to understand the need for software refactoring and rewrites. They ask: “It’s been working fine until now, why change it? And why the heck would I spend good money to rebuild something that I already have?”.
The short answer is, software behaves like a depreciable asset in accounting, or like a fruit. In time, it will progressively rot and lose its value, no matter what you do.</description>

      <description>My name is Pablo Borowicz. I live in Paris, France, and I&amp;rsquo;m a veteran software developer, team leader and manager. I started building stuff for the web for fun in 1998, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that professionally since 2003.
Back in the day people would categorize me as a full-stack developer, and although this definition is losing popularity these days due to the increasing complexity of each individual stack, I still think that full-stack is the most appropriate description for my domain of competence.</description>
